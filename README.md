# linkedlist_all_you_can_do

A menu driven program to perform various function on a linear linkedlist 


Linked List:
A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.
There are nodes that have two parts: data and address to another node

Singly Linked List(DLL):
Nodes of singly linked list contains a data field and an address field which contains the reference of the next node. Singly linked list can contain multiple data fields but should contain at least single address field pointing to its connected next node.

Doubly Linked List(DLL):
Similar to SLL, these have additional part in their node namely previous which contains address of previous node. It is better than SLL for forward and reverse traversal.

Circular Linked List(CLL):
Another modified version of SLL, here the last node points to the first node forming a circle. Any node can be the starting node and can be used to implement queue.

Another modification, Doubly circular linked list combines both the properties of the named.
